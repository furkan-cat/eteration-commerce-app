# eteration-commerce-app
E-commerce app with the ability to add products to the cart, filter and search. Filtering uses query strings, so if the user refreshes the page or opens a URL with query parameters, the app displays the filtered products accordingly.
Products in **cart** are stored in **LocalStorage**. This means that whenever the user opens the browser, the cart items remain.

## Tech
React, Redux Toolkit, Tailwindcss
